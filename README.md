## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It took me a long time to complete this challenge. I took a break for a while because I was struggling to position the background images. I was also of the opinion that it looked bad at different viewport sizes - it was responsive enough (or at all). After I had gained some more experience with background images, I took another swing at it. By then, I also knew a little more about Grid was able to construct a page that maintains a nice appearance at various sizes.

```css
.page {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 56% 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I need more practice with Grid and responsiveness.
